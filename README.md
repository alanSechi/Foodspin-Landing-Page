## NO RESPONSIVE : Desktop Only

### Description and technologies

Based on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XJqJJQ35oc), i wanted to to recrerate the project! I Just downloaded the Figma file created by the user and start coding it, using just *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *JavaScript*!

### How i made it:

* I've used **Trello** for organize tasks

* I've used **HTML** for the skeleton of the webpage (i defined all the components) 

* I've used **CSS** for the style of the page, like the position of the elements and the colors

* I've used **JAVASCRIPT** for four main reasons: 
 1. To use "the meals" as an objects taking advantage of its properties.
 2. To write the functions that makes me spin the central meal and the wheel around it.
 3. To position the small dishes in the wheel taking advantage of the tangent math properties.
 4. To change the color of the background and the buttons, and to change the meal description.
